        <h2>Unbelievable! Virat Kohli, the king of chases, has done it again </h2>
        <p>India are on their knees, reeling at 31 for 4, but Kohli stands tall. He anchors the innings, plays with such poise and precision, and guides India to victory. This is a knock for the ages</p>

        <h2>Rohit Sharma, the Hitman, is at the crease. Watch out bowlers </h2>
        <p>Rohit Sharma is on fire! He's timing the ball to perfection, finding gaps with disdain. The bowlers are helpless as he unleashes a barrage of boundaries. This is a masterclass in batting!</p>
